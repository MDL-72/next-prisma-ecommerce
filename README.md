## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Why are there 2 apps in the app folder?

This project is made up of 2 separate apps ( admin and storefront ) which should be deployed separately. If you are deploying with Vercel you should create 2 different apps.

![image](https://github.com/Accretence/next-prisma-tailwind-ecommerce/assets/45223699/f5adc1ac-9dbb-46cb-bb6e-a8db15883348)

Under the general tab there is a Root Directory option, for the admin app you should put in "apps/admin" and for the storefront app you should put in "apps/storefront".

## üîê Authentication

The authentication is handled using JWT tokens stored in cookies and verified inside the `middleware.ts` file. The middleware function takes in the HTTP request, reads the `token` cookie and if the JWT is successfully verified, it sets the `X-USER-ID` header with the userId as the value, otherwise the request is sent back with 401 status.

## üëÅ‚Äçüó® Environment variables

Environment variables are stored in `.env` files. By default the `.env.example` file is included in source control and contains
settings and defaults to get the app running. Any secrets or local overrides of these values should be placed in a
`.env` file, which is ignored from source control.

Remember, never commit and store `.env` in the source control, just only `.env.example` without any data specified.

You can [read more about environment variables here](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/environment-variables).

## üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Getting Started Locally

Clone the repository.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sesto-dev/next-prisma-tailwind-ecommerce
```

Navigate to each folder in the `apps` folder and set the variables.

```sh
# For storefront
cd apps/storefront
cp .env.example .env

# For admin
cd apps/admin
cp .env.example .env
```

Get all dependencies sorted.

```sh
# From project root
bun install
```

Set up your database and seed with sample data.

```bash
# For storefront
cd apps/storefront
bun run db:push
bun run db:seed

# For admin (uses same database)
cd apps/admin
bun run db:push
```

Start the development servers.

```sh
# Storefront (port 7777)
cd apps/storefront
bun run dev

# Admin (port 8888) - in a new terminal
cd apps/admin
bun run dev
```

```

## üéØ Design Decisions & Implementation Approach

### 1. Advanced Product Filtering
**Approach**: Built a flexible query system using Prisma's advanced filtering capabilities.
- **Multi-select categories**: Used Prisma's `some` operator with array matching
- **Price range**: Implemented `gte` and `lte` operators for precise filtering
- **Search**: Combined `OR` conditions for title and description matching
- **Sorting**: Dynamic `orderBy` based on user selection

**Design Decision**: Kept filtering server-side for better performance and SEO, with URL state management for shareable filtered views.

### 2. Cross-Sell Product Recommendations
**Approach**: Implemented bidirectional many-to-many relationships using Prisma's self-referencing relations.
- **Database Schema**: Added `crossSellProducts` and `crossSellOf` relations to Product model
- **Bidirectional Links**: Ensured both products in a relationship can recommend each other
- **Smart Suggestions**: Deduplicated cross-sell products in cart suggestions
- **Performance**: Used Prisma includes to fetch related data efficiently

**Design Decision**: Made relationships bidirectional to ensure all products can show relevant suggestions, not just the "source" product.

### 3. Admin Reports Dashboard
**Approach**: Created a comprehensive analytics system with real-time data aggregation.
- **Revenue Analytics**: Implemented date-range filtering and chart visualization
- **Sales Metrics**: Built efficient counting queries with proper indexing
- **Stock Monitoring**: Added real-time stock level tracking
- **Modular Design**: Separated report logic into reusable utility functions

**Design Decision**: Used server-side data fetching for better performance and real-time accuracy, with client-side chart rendering for interactivity.

### 4. Development Experience
**Approach**: Enhanced developer productivity with better tooling and debugging.
- **Auth Bypass**: Added development-only authentication bypass for easier testing
- **Seed Data**: Created comprehensive seed data with cross-sell relationships
- **Type Safety**: Maintained full TypeScript coverage with proper Prisma types
- **Error Handling**: Implemented comprehensive error handling and user feedback

**Design Decision**: Prioritized developer experience while maintaining production security through environment-based feature flags.

## üîë Database

Prisma ORM can use any PostgreSQL database. [Supabase is the easiest to work with.](https://www.prisma.io/docs/guides/database/supabase) Simply set `DATABASE_URL` in your `.env` file to work.

### `bun run db`

This project exposes a package.json script for accessing prisma via `bun run db:<command>`. You should always try to use this script when interacting with prisma locally.

### Making changes to the database schema

Make changes to your database by modifying `prisma/schema.prisma`.
